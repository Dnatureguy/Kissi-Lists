# Kissi-List
  The first project I decided to create is a quiz app project. This is the first project in my Kissi Lists. Kissi Lists consist of the many and helpful projects that I have set to build before the end of this year. I believe this journey is going to help me sharpen my skills as a front-end dev.

#Kiisi-Quiz
  This is going to be a website created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was suppposed to make it a back-end project, but I want to use this medium to practice and strengthen my frontend skills.
